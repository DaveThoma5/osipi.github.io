title: "OSIPI Task Force 6.1: Challenges"
aims: Develop and implement challenges involving perfusion imaging analysis
description: |
  Development of benchmarks and application to existing software. 
  Using the data collected in aim #3, develop metrics that quantify the performance of a perfusion analysis tool (eg. bias and precision on DROâ€™s, agreement with reference methods in-vivo, reproducibility on in-vivo data, processing time, etc). 
  These metrics will be measured for the software tools collected in aims #1 and #2 in order to establish a set of benchmarks. 
  The long-term aim is to establish OSIPI as an independent arbiter for software solutions in perfusion imaging. 
  TF 6.1 will focus on the developing and implementing challenges.
