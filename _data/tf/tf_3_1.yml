title: "OSIPI Task Force 3.1: Digital Reference Objects and Phantoms"
aims: Build an inventory of digital reference objects and phantoms
description: |
  Develop an inventory of data for the evaluation of perfusion software. 
  This is aimed at researchers looking for data to test their perfusion analysis methods, and at data owners who want to share data for secondary research. 
  The inventory will provide a curated list of publicly available synthetic, phantom, preclinical and clinical perfusion datasets. 
  Digital reference objects (DROs) and phantom data can serve as ground truth for perfusion analysis methods, and in-vivo data can be used to test algorithms in real-world conditions for robustness, reproducibility and practicality. 
  TF 3.1 builds an inventory of DROs and phantoms.
