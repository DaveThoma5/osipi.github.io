title: "OSIPI Task Force 2.3: DCE/DSC contributions"
aims: Collect and harmonise DCE/DSC code snippets from developers
description: |
  Develop a library of open-source functions, scripts and pipelines for perfusion imaging analysis. 
  This is aimed at developers of perfusion methods looking for specific functionality or development templates, or who want to share their own in-house developments with others. 
  Contributions will be sourced from the community, and may include individual functions and more complete pipelines in various programming languages. 
  OSIPI will organise these in a coherent and well-documented library structure, then identify and develop any missing functionality. 
  TF 2.3 will populate the library with DCE/DSC code snippets from developers.
