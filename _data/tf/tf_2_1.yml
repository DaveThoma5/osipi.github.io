title: "OSIPI Task Force 2.1: Library structure and management"
aims: |
  Define and manage the library for ASL, DCE and DSC code snippets collected and harmonized by task forces 2.2 and 2.3. 
  This includes defining the structure of the library, licensing, naming conventions, documentation conventions, version control, code review, etc..
description: |
  Develop a library of open-source functions, scripts and pipelines for perfusion imaging analysis. 
  This is aimed at developers of perfusion methods looking for specific functionality or development templates, or who want to share their own in-house developments with others. 
  Contributions will be sourced from the community, and may include individual functions and more complete pipelines in various programming languages. 
  OSIPI will organise these in a coherent and well-documented library structure, then identify and develop any missing functionality. 
  TF 2.1 will define and manage the library structure.
