title: "OSIPI Task Force 3.2: Clinical and preclinical data"
aims: Build an inventory of freely available clinical and preclinical perfusion MRI data.
description: |
  The inventory is aimed at researchers looking for data to test their perfusion analysis methods, and at data owners who want to share data for secondary research. 
  The inventory will provide a curated list of publicly available preclinical and clinical perfusion datasets that can be used to test algorithms in real-world conditions for robustness, reproducibility and practicality. 
  Task force 3.2 will initially focus on identifying, listing and qualifying existing datasets. 
  In a second phase we may identify gaps in the available data and take actions to fill them.
