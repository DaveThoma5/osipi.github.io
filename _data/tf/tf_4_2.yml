title: "OSIPI Task Force 4.2: DCE/DSC lexicon"
aims: Develop guidelines for reporting of DCE/DSC image acquisition and analysis
description: |
  Develop consensus guidelines for reporting image acquisition and analysis of perfusion imaging. 
  This will enable interoperability and facilitate the comparison of results produced by different analysis tools, studies or sites. 
  We aim to harmonize and increase the detail in the description of parameters and configurations, enable encoding of the complete perfusion imaging workflow, and pave the way for consensus building. 
  An important application will be the amendment of the DICOM standard for perfusion parametric maps, as well as BIDS extensions, and development of demonstrations and use cases. 
  TF 4.2 will create the DCE/DSC lexicon.
