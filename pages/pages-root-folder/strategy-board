The Strategy Board (SB) represents the stakeholders within OSIPI 
and maintains the Strategic Plan outlining the mission, aims and general approach of OSIPI. 

The SB consists of the OSIPI and perfusion Study group leadership teams, as well as any number of
advisory members representing other bodies with an interest in perfusion open source software. 
This could include other ISMRM study groups and/or other societies or more informal networks.

If you are interested to represent an external body within the SB, please contact the OSIPI chair.
