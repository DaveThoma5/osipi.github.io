**This task force is part of aim 1:**

Develop a comprehensive inventory of complete open source packages for perfusion imaging analysis. This is aimed at end-users looking for a suitable tool to process their data. The inventory will list available open-source tools, providing information that will help users to select a suitable tool, such as scope of application, methodology, level of validation, licence policy, transparency, user-friendliness, and reviews by other users. TF 1.2 provides this for DCE/DSC software.
