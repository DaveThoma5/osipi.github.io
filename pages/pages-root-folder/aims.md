Aims
----------
OSIPI's aims are always open to be discussed and amended by the community. As of now, this is OSIPI's growing list of actionable aims presented in May 2019:

1. [**Software inventory: Develop a comprehensive inventory of complete open source packages for perfusion imaging analysis**](/aims/software-inventory/) This is aimed at end-users looking for a suitable tool to process their data. This inventory will list available open-source tools, providing information that will help users to select a suitable tool, such as scope of application, methodology, level of validation, licence policy, transparency, user-friendliness, and reviews by other users.
2. [**Toolbox: Develop a library of open-source functions, scripts and pipelines for perfusion imaging analysis**](/aims/toolbox/) This is aimed at developers of perfusion methods looking for specific functionality or development templates, or who want to share their own in-house developments with others. Contributions will be sourced from the community, and may include individual functions and more complete pipelines in various programming languages. OSIPI will organise these in a coherent and well-documented library structure, then identify and develop any missing functionality.
3. [**Data inventory: Develop an inventory of data for the evaluation of perfusion software**](/aims/data-inventory/) This is aimed at researchers looking for data to test their perfusion analysis methods, and at data owners who want to share data for secondary research. The inventory will provide a curated list of publicly available synthetic, phantom, preclinical and clinical perfusion datasets. Digital reference objects (DROs) and phantom data can serve as ground truth for perfusion analysis methods, and in-vivo data can be used to test algorithms in real-world conditions for robustness, reproducibility and practicality.
4. [**Reporting: Develop guidelines for reporting image acquisition and analysis of perfusion imaging**](/aims/reporting-guidelines/) This will enable interoperability and facilitate the comparison of results produced by different analysis tools, studies or sites. We aim to harmonize and increase the detail in the description of parameters and configurations, enable encoding of the complete perfusion imaging workflow, and pave the way for consensus building. An important application will be the amendment of the DICOM standard for perfusion parametric maps, and development of demonstrations and use cases.
5. [**Exchange: Develop a platform for discussion and exchange between developers and users of perfusion software**](/aims/exchange/) Effective communication is a key prerequisite for the realisation of the aims, but also to ensure long-term sustainability of the initiative. Through the use of novel communication media and organisation of events, OSIPI will build an active community promoting networking, communication, guidance and discussion.
6. [**Benchmarking: Development of benchmarks and application to existing software**](/aims/benchmarking/) Using the data collected in aim 3, develop metrics that quantify the performance of a perfusion analysis tool (eg. bias and precision on DRO’s, agreement with reference methods in-vivo, reproducibility on in-vivo data, processing time, …). These metrics will be measured for the software tools collected in aims 1 and 2 in order to establish a set of benchmarks. The long-term aim is to establish OSIPI as an independent arbiter for software solutions in perfusion imaging.

Task Forces
--------------------
Task forces are the OSIPI means to implement the [aims](/aims/).

A *task force* is a group of OSIPI community volunteers with the interest and expertise in the subject matter of a specific aim, who are actively working on a specific task towards achieving this aim. They are open for participation by anyone in the OSIPI community. 

Proposal for task forces can arise from members of the community. A single aim can have multiple task-forces, depending on the number of tasks that are required to implement the aim. Each task force is assigned one or more leads that direct activities of the task force and report to the EMB about the progress at the intervals mutually agreed between the task force and the EMB. Members of the community can join existing task forces at any time, but this needs to be agreed on with the existing members of the task force.

Task forces define their own scope and milestones. These can be changed if necessary, but requires approval of the EMB, in order to avoid duplicated work, or work outside of the scope of the task-force or aim.
Once the task is achieved, the task force may be closed. 


Contribute
--------------------
If you want to get involved, feel free to add your name to the task forces in any of these aims or feel free to reach out to us. At any time, we welcome feedback about OSIPI activities and the aims listed above! You can reach out to individual EMB members or contribute your feedback by posting to the [OSIPI forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/open-source-initiative-for-perfusion-imaging).

If you have feedback specifically about the formulation of the aims, you can also leave comments in [this google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10OhbXTRGPuToYLy-cFof9TreX0DS_yhs_8wJeIw5SIU/edit).
