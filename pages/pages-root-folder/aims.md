The current [Strategic Plan](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14XZYB59W2rn5NIMBKEwdzht23WLa3zzN/view) for OSIPI defines six actionable aims, each of which are addressed by one or more independent task forces:


**Aim 1. Software inventory**
-----------------------------

[**Develop a comprehensive inventory of complete open source packages for perfusion imaging analysis**](/aims/software-inventory/) 

*This is aimed at end-users looking for a suitable tool to process their data. The inventory will list available open-source tools, providing information that will help users to select a suitable tool, such as scope of application, methodology, level of validation, licence policy, transparency, user-friendliness, and reviews by other users.*

   Task Force 1.1 - ASL Inventory <br/>
      1. Udunna Anazodo <br/>
      2. Sudipto Dolui <br/>
      3. David Thomas <br/>
      4. Jan Petr <br/>
      5. *open position* <br/>
      6. *open position* <br/>
      7. *open position* <br/>
      8. *open position* <br/>
      
   Task Force 1.2 - DCE/DSC Inventory <br/>
      1. Benoit Bourassa Moreau <br/>
      2. Andrey Fedorov <br/>
      3. Ingomar Gutmann <br/>
      4. Ives Levesque <br/>
      5. Sudarshan Ragunathan <br/>
      6. Patrick Thurner <br/>
      7. *open position* <br/>
      8. *open position* <br/>
   

**Aim 2. Toolbox**
------------------

[**Develop a library of open-source functions, scripts and pipelines for perfusion imaging analysis**](/aims/toolbox/)

   Task Force - Library Structure and Management (TBD lead, TBD co-lead)<br/>
   Task Force - ASL Contributions (TBD lead, TBD co-lead)<br/>
   Task Force - DCE/DSC Contributions (TBD lead, TBD co-lead)
   

**Aim 3. Data inventory**
-------------------------

[**Develop an inventory of data for the evaluation of perfusion software**](/aims/data-inventory/) 

   Task Force - Digital Reference Objects and Phantoms (TBD lead, TBD co-lead)<br/>
   Task Force - Clinical and Preclinical Data (TBD lead, TBD co-lead)
   

**Aim 4. Reporting**
--------------------

[**Develop guidelines for reporting image acquisition and analysis of perfusion imaging**](/aims/reporting-guidelines/) 

   Task Force - ASL Lexicon (TBD lead, TBD co-lead)<br/>
   Task Force - DCE/DSC Lexicon (TBD lead, Ina Kompan co-lead)


**Aim 5. Platform for exchange**
--------------------------------

[**Exchange: Develop a platform for discussion and exchange between developers and users of perfusion software**](/aims/exchange/) 

   Task Force - Teaching and Education (TBD lead, TBD co-lead)<br/>
   Task Force - Dissemination and Events (TBD lead, TBD co-lead)


**Aim 6. Benchmarking**
-----------------------

[**Development of benchmarks and application to existing software**](/aims/benchmarking/)

   Task Force - Development of Benchmarking (TBD lead, TBD co-lead)<br/>


**Get involved!**
-----------------

We highly encourage anyone interested to get involved - if you feel you can contribute to one of the task forces, please reach out to the lead directly (contact details above). You can reach out to individuals participating or contribute your feedback by posting to the [OSIPI forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/open-source-initiative-for-perfusion-imaging).
