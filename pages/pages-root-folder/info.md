OSIPI is an initiative that is supported by the [ISMRM Perfusion Study Group](https://www.ismrm.org/study-groups/perfusion-mr/). We are an international community that recognizes the current struggle to find a robust perfusion analysis software. As many of us have developed customized perfusion tools, we want to create a platform to share a wide range of tools (perfusion code, digital references, clinical & preclinical data) such that perfusion analysis can be evaluated. We want to produce reproducible science in order to support clinical translation of perfusion imaging.

We are bootstrapped by energetic volunteers from our international community that form several different **Task Forces**. These Task Forces are responsible for delivering the [current aims](/aims/). Each Task Force is led by a senior and junior researcher with the relevant expertise/interest. We encourage anyone with suggestions regarding the aims and/or Task Forces to get involved.

Currently overseeing the Task Forces are:
* [**Steven Sourbron**](https://medicinehealth.leeds.ac.uk/medicine/staff/782/dr-steven-sourbron/), University of Leeds, UK (chair)
* **Laura Bell**, Barrow Neurological Institute, Phoenix, AZ, USA (co-chair)
* **Henk-Jan Mutsaerts**, Amsterdam UMC/UMC Utrecht, Netherlands (secretary)
* **Charlotte Debus**, German Aerospace Center, Cologne, Germany (past-chair)

*A bit of history...* in the fall of 2018, Steven Sourbron and Laura Bell sent out a call-to-action survey to the ISMRM Perfusion Study Group. There were over 100 responses of people supporting and eager in helping with a perfusion open source initiative.  From this, a small group of volunteers (Laura Bell, Patricia Clement, Charlotte Debus, Andrey Fedorov, Simon Levy, Steven Sourbron, and Frank Zollner) met monthly for a year to bring OSIPIâ€™s mission and specific aims to fruition.
