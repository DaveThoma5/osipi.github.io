**This task force is part of aim 6:**

Development of benchmarks and application to existing software. Using the data collected in aim #3, develop metrics that quantify the performance of a perfusion analysis tool (eg. bias and precision on DROâ€™s, agreement with reference methods in-vivo, reproducibility on in-vivo data, processing time, etc). These metrics will be measured for the software tools collected in aims #1 and #2 in order to establish a set of benchmarks. The long-term aim is to establish OSIPI as an independent arbiter for software solutions in perfusion imaging. TF 6.1 will focus on the developing and implementing challenges.
