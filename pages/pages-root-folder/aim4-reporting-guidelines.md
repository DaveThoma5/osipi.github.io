**Aim Guidelines for Reporting: Develop guidelines for reporting image acquisition and analysis of perfusion imaging** 

This will enable interoperability and facilitate the comparison of results produced by different analysis tools, studies or sites. We aim to harmonize and increase the detail in the description of parameters and configurations, enable encoding of the complete perfusion imaging workflow, and pave the way for consensus building. An important application will be the amendment of the DICOM standard for perfusion parametric maps, and development of demonstrations and use cases.
