title: "OSIPI Task Force 1.2: DCE/DSC software inventory"
aims: Create an inventory of available DCE/DSC packages
description: |
  Develop a comprehensive inventory of complete open source packages for perfusion imaging analysis. 
  This is aimed at end-users looking for a suitable tool to process their data. 
  The inventory will list available open-source tools, providing information that will help users to select a suitable tool, such as scope of application, methodology, level of validation, licence policy, transparency, user-friendliness, and reviews by other users. 
  TF 1.2 provides this for DCE/DSC software.
