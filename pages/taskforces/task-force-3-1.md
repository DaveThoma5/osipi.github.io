title: "OSIPI Task Force 3.1: Digital Reference Objects and Phantoms"
aims: Build an inventory of digital reference objects and phantom data for perfusion MRI.
description: |
  The inventory is aimed at researchers looking for data to test their perfusion analysis methods, and at data owners who want to share data for secondary research. 
  The inventory developed by Task force 3.1 will include a curated list of publicly available digital reference objects (DROs), synthetic and phantom data that can serve as ground truth for perfusion analysis methods.
  Task force 3.1 will initially focus on identifying, listing and qualifying existing datasets. 
  In a second phase we may identify gaps in the available data and take actions to fill them.
